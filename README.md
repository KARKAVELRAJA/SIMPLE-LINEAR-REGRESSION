# SIMPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT HOUSE PRICE

- Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and the output is predicted
- Finally, the predicted output is verified
